When the Apple Watch first came out last year, Engadget published not one but two reviews.
There was the "official" review, which provided an overview of the device's features and,
more important, attempted to explain who, if anyone, should buy it.
Then there was a piece I wrote, focusing specifically on the watch's
capabilities (actually, drawbacks) as a running watch. Although we knew that many readers
would be interested in that aspect of the device, we were wary of derailing the review by
geeking out about marathoning.

This year, we needn't worry about that. With the new Apple Watch Series 2,
the company is explicitly positioning the device as a sports watch.
In particular, the second generation brings a built-in GPS radio for more accurate
distance tracking on runs, walks, hikes, bike rides and swims.
Yes, swims: It's also waterproof this time, safe for submersion in up to 50 meters of water.

Beyond that, the other changes are performance-related, including a faster chip,
longer battery life and a major software update that makes the watch easier to use.
Even so, the first-gen version, which will continue to be sold at a lower price,
is getting upgraded with the same firmware and dual-core processor.
That means, then, that the Series 2's distinguishing features are mostly about fitness.
And if you don't fancy yourself an athlete, we can think of an even smarter buy.
